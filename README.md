# Attendes list
This app includes a small API to return the processed data, and a simple UI to allow not technical people to upload files directly. This UI returns the data on the screen, but also allows the user to download it as a .TXT file.

It's also possible to fetch the JSON result in case we want to integrate this service with any other (for example, to send the e-mails to the attendees).

## how to run

```yarn install```
```yarn start```

After running, you can access the solution through localhost:3000.
  

## how to test
